            <h2>Audio</h2>

            <p>This is funny sound clip from one of my good friends, Al. <br>
            You can use <kbd>space</kbd> to pause/resume the audio once focused.
            </p>

            <audio controls>
                <source src="../assets/Al-Ringtone.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                Your browser does not support this audio.
            </audio>

            <p>Meanwhile, I couldn't think of a good video to add, since I also didn't want to just throw a massive file onto this website, so here's some web-devlopment I was doing. (guess what website I was working on)</p>

            <video controls autoplay muted>
                <source src="../assets/development-recording.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support this video.
            </video>

            <pre>
                Well, that's all I have for tags.

                I still need to make 2 custom elements, though.

                This one's <code>pre</code>, so I can do stuff      like      this.
            </pre>
